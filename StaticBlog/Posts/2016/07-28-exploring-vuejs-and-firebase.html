    A while back I started experimenting with the up and coming javascript library <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">VueJS</a> for an internal admin dashboard for Talentdepo.<br>
    I started learning about VueJS at Laracasts where they have a great <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/learning-vue-step-by-step" target="_blank" rel="external">mostly free series about VueJS</a>.<br>
    I was a little skeptical about yet another JavaScript framework/library to solve our modern day SPA needs.<br>
    Though VueJS felt like a breath of fresh air. It is both refreshingly new, yet still very familiar (to AngularJS or MVVM in .NET.)

    After working with it for a few months on personal and professional projects, I liked it so much that I wanted to share it with other people.<br>
    I put together a neat little <a href="https://gkeep-vueifire2.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">note app</a> that is inspired on Google Keep and wrote a small series about it at <a href="https://scotch.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Scotch.io</a>.<br>
    The Google Keep clone is built with VueJS 1 en Firebase 1 and you can build it yourself by following the series. 
    If you want to learn more about VueJS or Firebase and its great features, you can find the series on my <a href="https://pub.scotch.io/@sniels" target="_blank" rel="external">Scotch profile</a>.<br>
    The code is also on <a href="https://github.com/SNiels/gkeep-vueifire" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub</a>.
